# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

To Do 
1) Set up mock environments for redux, react-router, axios requests, etc

Tests Left on Front End : 
1) Routing
2) Redux - Actions, Reducers, Store, Selectors
3) Hooks
4) Higher Order Components
5) Navbar and Layout components
6) Pages

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
2) Documentation
