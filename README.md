# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

To Do 
1) Set up mock environments for react-router(Memory router with initial entries) and mocking axios requests - relook at mock store package instead of current solution I created (It seems much clearer)
2) Actions
3) Finish layout and navbar component tests - this can only be done once the mock environments are set up
