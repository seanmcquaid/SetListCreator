# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

To Do 
1) Reducer and selector tests - by far the easiest things to test
2) Set up mock environments for react-router(Memory router with initial entries) and mocking axios requests
3) Finish layout and navbar component tests - this can only be done once the mock environments are set up

React Router

Redux

Tests Left on Front End : 
1) Routing
2) Redux - Actions, Reducers, Selectors
3) Hooks
4) Higher Order Components
5) Navbar and Layout components
6) Pages

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
2) Documentation
