# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Tests Left For Unit Testing on Front End : 
1) Refactor all tests using mock store to use configured store now - much cleaner and realistic
2) BandleaderPages - Add Songs, Edit Song, Home, Login, Profile, Register, Client Edit Set List, Client Final Set List, Client Info, Client List, Set List Creator
3) ClientPages - Edit Song, Home, Login, Profile, Register, Send Set List, Set List Approval, Finalized Set List

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests - Front End
2) Refactoring / Code Review - Front End
3) End to End tests in Cypress
4) Remove unused packages
5) Documentation
