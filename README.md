# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Tests Left on Back End : 
1) Integration - Client

Order for Back End Tests: 
1) Integration - Client
2) Fix failing tests
3) Look at syntax for each suite and make it more uniform to the same testing patterns

Things to Fix on Front End : 
1) Look at implementing useMemo and useCallback where appropriate to eliminate potential excessive amount of render cycles

Tests Left on Front End : 
1) Components
2) Routing
3) Redux - Actions, Reducers, Store, Selectors
4) Hooks
5) Higher Order Components
6) Pages

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
3) Documentation
