# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Things I am going to fix :
1) Refactor requests that only get one item to an object instead of sending an array with one item
2) Redirect Bugs in HOC for Client / Bandleader
3) Styling
4) Review Syntax / Spacing

Things to do after fixing :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
