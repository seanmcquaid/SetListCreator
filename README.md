# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Things I am going to fix :
1) Add flow for editing a setlist based on client comments if client doesnt approve
2) Fix casing for Setlist throughout app - setlist => setList, bandLeader => bandleader
3) Error Message Handling - rethink strategy with redux to clear error messaging
4) Remove password from response
5) Redirect Bugs in HOC for Client / Bandleader
6) Styling

Things to do after fixing :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
