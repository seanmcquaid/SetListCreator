# Set List Creator

1) Unit Test Refactoring - Look at each test for each page to review assertions for elements on page/ not on page

Things to do :
1) Refactoring / Code Review - look at adding timeout to actions so isloading actually can render loadingspinner for appropriate period of time
2) Review ALL tests and make sure it's accurately mocking expected app behavior - I speculate that my back end tests aren't as accurate as they could be
3) End to End tests in Cypress
4) Remove unused packages
5) Documentation
