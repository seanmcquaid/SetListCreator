To Do :
1) Refactor - Verify that back end response and reducers line up properly
2) Clean up weird token error that occurs when an invalid token is found
3) Work on Error Handling/ Messaging with Errors - SHOULD NOT BE STORED IN REDUCER!
4) Client Send Set List Page - Client 
5) Client List Page => Set List Creation Page - Band Leader
6) Restructure Architecture for Pages, Components, Reducers, etc? 
7) Rearchitect reducers - I feel like it's getting a bit cluttered now - Will need to figure out error handling properly - componentDidCatch could be a solution and maybe we can make an error component ?
