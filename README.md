# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Things I am going to fix :
1) Client pages styling
2) Use react - redux hooks instead of connect HOC - https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks
3) Review Syntax / Spacing

<!-- media query for page size to change stacking of page-->


General Styling Audit Fixes :
1) Navbar

Things to do after fixing :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
