# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Things I am going to fix :
1) UI / UX - Review use of link buttons and consider normal button with on click instead to use router to push history
2) Initial band leader pages are more or less done - review the responsive design then dig into each page sub sets
3) Review Syntax / Spacing

Things to do after fixing :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
