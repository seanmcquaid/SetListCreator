# Set List Creator

Things to do :
1) Refactor unit tests to implement screen per the creator of RTL's recommendation and review testing patterns/unify patterns, remove unneeded setting of store initial state
2) Refactoring / Code Review - Front End - look at adding timeout to actions so isloading actually can render loadingspinner for appropriate period of time & add in axios cancelling like the changes on the client setlist approval page
3) Review ALL tests and make sure it's accurately mocking expected app behavior - I speculate that my back end tests aren't as accurate as they could be
4) End to End tests in Cypress
5) Remove unused packages
6) Documentation
