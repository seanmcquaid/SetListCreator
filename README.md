4) Client Send Set List Page - Client 
5) Client List Page => Set List Creation Page - Band Leader
6) Rearchitect reducers - I feel like it's getting a bit cluttered now - Will need to figure out error handling properly - componentDidCatch could be a solution and maybe we can make an error component ?
