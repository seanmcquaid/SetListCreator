# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Things I am going to fix :
1) Initial band leader pages are more or less done - review the responsive design then dig into each page sub sets
2) Client pages
2) Review Syntax / Spacing

<!-- media query for page size to change stacking of page-->

Styling Audit Fixes for Bandleader : 
1) Set List Page - Borders fixing
2) Set List Creator Page - Fix Stacking

Things to do after fixing :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
