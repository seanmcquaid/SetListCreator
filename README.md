# Set List Creator
This has been a long standing passion project of mine that I spent roughly 10 months working on every day after work and on the weekends. The idea came to me after talking to a bandleader for a wedding band who mentioned that his biggest problem is spending time trying to create an ideal set list for a client. After meeting with him a few times to get loose requirements, I started working on it. 

The app features two different kinds of accounts that have a slew of different functionality for each account type : 

### Client
The main focus for the Client account is to easily allow clients to select their bandleader, enter both songs that they want played and songs they ABSOLUTELY don't want played at their wedding. Once a client has submitted their requests to their bandleader, they then wait for the bandleader to send them a proposed set list. 

The client then has the option to add comments and then either approve or disapprove the proposed set list. If the set list isn't approved, it is sent back to the bandleader for review. If it is approved, then the client is able to view their finalized set list.

### Bandleader
The main focus of the Bandleader account is to allow bandleader to add songs to their song database, and manage their various client set lists. 

Once a client has submitted their requests for review, the client will see their status change from "In Progress" to "Ready" on the Clients List Page. The algorithm will spit out a recommended set list based on what the bandleader knows and what the client has requested they do and don't play. Once a bandleader has finished the set list, they can then send it to the client for review. Depending on the client's response, the bandleader can either address their concerns or their set list process is done!
