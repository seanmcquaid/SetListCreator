# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.

Tests Left For Unit Testing on Front End : 
1) Navbar
2) Look into configuring a "mock" real store - configureStore(rootReducer, initialState) could be the answer
3) Pages

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests - Front End
2) Refactoring / Code Review - Front End
3) Documentation
