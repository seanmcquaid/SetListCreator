# Set List Creator

I have more or less finished the basic app now, it will be primarily refactoring to clean up things that bother me about the app before considering this completed.


To Do - Back End: 
1) Fix failing tests
2) Look at syntax for each suite and make it more uniform to the same testing patterns

To Do - Front End : 
1) Look at implementing useMemo and useCallback where appropriate to eliminate potential excessive amount of render cycles

Tests Left on Front End : 
1) Components
2) Routing
3) Redux - Actions, Reducers, Store, Selectors
4) Hooks
5) Higher Order Components
6) Pages

Things to do :
1) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Back End 
2) Unit Tests + Refactoring - Front End
3) Documentation
